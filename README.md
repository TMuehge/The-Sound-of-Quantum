I love music and in particular Jazz music.<br/>
For me this type of music is very innovative and inclusive with a strong motivation to step accross borders (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_Across_the_Border_(soundtrack)).<br/>

**What is music?** <br/>

Physically sound is a mechanical longitudinal or compression air wave.<br/>
The air particles are coupled between each other which means that they are somehow connected via elastic springs causing air particles moving back and forward. <br/>
This coupling is the reason, why introduced motion by for instance a loudspeaker propagates as a wave.<br/>
The ear is decomposing the airwave into the set of frequencies and is performing a biological fourier analysis.
The composition of different frequencies over time can be noise, speech or if done right music.<br/>

**How to relate it to quantumÂ  computing?**<br/>

Quantum computers consists on qubits. This are very fragile elements that can act completely probabilitic in case the programmer wants them to behave in such a way.<br/>
With an operation called the H gate we move the qubit state from the north pole or the 0 state to the equator.
In order to get information on the state we need to measure the qubit state.<br/>
Here we have a 50% probability for the qubit to be in the zero and a 50% probability to be in the 1 state.<br/>

**How to turn this into sound?**<br/>

If we measure our qubit one time the output will be either a 0 or a 1.<br/>
If we measure twice the outpot will be either two times 0, two times 1, or a 0,1 combination.<br/>
It turns into music if we associate the output 0 to a defined sound frequency like e.g. 261.63 Hz equivalent to a C and the output 1 to 392.00 Hz equivalent to a G.<br/>
The amplitudes of each tone is defined by the normalized counts of the 0 or 1.<br/>
Please note, that this technique provides a substantial probabilistic music output only for low numbers of measurements. The more measurements you take the closer the conts will be equally devided between zeros and ones.<br/>

**How to make music?**<br/>
If we add one more qubit we increase the number of different output combination from 2 to 4.<br/>
Now we have (0,0), (1,1), (1,0) and (0,1).<br/>
If we assiciate each of the four outputs to a musical note we can choose four different notes.<br/>
Again we can associate the normalized counts of each output to an amplitude.<br/>
If we play the notes in a sequence we have one bar with 4 quarter notes. <br/>
A zero amplitude is associated with a quarter pause.<br/> <br/>
Now with repeating the 2 qubit experiment multiple times we can create multiple bars of music. <br/>

**How to make qubits playing blues?**<br/>
If we associate the 4 different output combinations to e.g. the A minor blues pentatonic scale, our qubits will start playing blues! <br/>
Let's try it out ! <br/>
