I love music and in particular Jazz music. For me this type of music is very innovative and inclusive with a strong motivation to step accross borders (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_Across_the_Border_(soundtrack)).
What is music? 
Physically sond is a mechanical longitudinal or compression air wave.
The air particles are coupled between each other which means that they are somehow connected via elastic springs causing air particles moving back and forward. This coupling is the reason, why introduced motion by for instance a loudspeaker propagates as a wave.
The ear is decomposing the airwave into the set of frequencies and is performing a biological fourier analysis.
The composition of different frequencies over time can be noise, speech or if done right music.
How to relate it to quantum  computing?
Quantum computers consists on qubits. This are very fragile elements that can act completely probabilitic in case the programmer wants them to behave in such a way.
With an operation called the H gate we move the qubit state from the north pole or the 0 state to the equator.
In order to get information on the state we need to measure the qubit state.
Here we have a 50% probability for the qubit to be in the zero and a 50% probability to be in the 1 state.
So how to turn this into sound?
